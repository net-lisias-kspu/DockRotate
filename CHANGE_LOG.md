# Dock Rotate /L Unleashed :: Change Log

* 2018-1102: 1.5.1.17 (peteletroll) for KSP 1.4.3.
	+ Now rotation can be continuous (set rotation step to 0) and fast (new UI for wider speed range up to 3600°/s).
	+ New UI for fine control of rotation step from 1°/s to 360°/s.
	+ You can definitely make action controlled variable-pitch propellers.
	+ Compiled for 1.5.1, but should work with 1.4.* too.
* 2018-1018: 1.4.4.16 (peteletroll) for KSP 1.4.3.
	+ If the rotation step is set to 0, the rotation will be continuous. You can stop it with the "Stop Rotation" right-click menu entry, the "Stop Rotation" action, or Alt-B.
	+ This release is compiled on 1.4.5, but works on 1.5.0 too.
* 2018-0706: 1.4.4.15 (peteletroll) for KSP 1.4.3.
	+ If you press the modifier keys (Alt on Windows, Right Shift on Linux), all rotation actions are reversed: for example, if "1" rotates a port clockwise, "Mod-1" will rotate it counterclockwise.
	+ All docking/undocking/decoupling events while moving are handled properly now.
	+ These improvements make building robotic grappling arms practical.
* 2018-0622: 1.4.3.14 (peteletroll) for KSP 1.4.3.
	+ Recompiled for 1.4.3. Should work with any 1.4.* anyway.
		- Lots of refactoring. I apparently like moving code around a lot.
		- Better handling of going on rails while moving.
