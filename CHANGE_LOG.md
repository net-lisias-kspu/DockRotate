# Dock Rotate /L Unleashed :: Change Log

* 2019-0210: 1.6.1.23 (peteletroll) for KSP 1.4.3.
	+ 1) added flip-flop mode for deploy/release with a single action group;
	+ 2) HUGE refactoring, now almost everything is a MonoBehaviour.
* 2019-0118: 1.6.1.22 (peteletroll) for KSP 1.4.3.
	+ Robotic arms with Advanced Grabbing Units work much better now.
* 2018-1225: 1.5.1.21 (peteletroll) for KSP 1.4.3.
	+ Bug fixes, optimizations, random refactoring... the usual stuff.
* 2018-1124: 1.5.1.20 (peteletroll) for KSP 1.4.3.
	+ This is for variable AoA propellers.
* 2018-1116: 1.5.1.19 (peteletroll) for KSP 1.4.3.
	+ NodeRotate now works when attached to physicsless parts too (it actually converts them to full physics parts).
	+ And a new motor part by Psycho_zs.
* 2018-1112: 1.5.1.18 (peteletroll) for KSP 1.4.3.
	+ No changelog provided
* 2018-1102: 1.5.1.17 (peteletroll) for KSP 1.4.3.
	+ Now rotation can be continuous (set rotation step to 0) and fast (new UI for wider speed range up to 3600°/s).
	+ New UI for fine control of rotation step from 1°/s to 360°/s.
	+ You can definitely make action controlled variable-pitch propellers.
	+ Compiled for 1.5.1, but should work with 1.4.* too.
* 2018-1018: 1.4.4.16 (peteletroll) for KSP 1.4.3.
	+ If the rotation step is set to 0, the rotation will be continuous. You can stop it with the "Stop Rotation" right-click menu entry, the "Stop Rotation" action, or Alt-B.
	+ This release is compiled on 1.4.5, but works on 1.5.0 too.
* 2018-0706: 1.4.4.15 (peteletroll) for KSP 1.4.3.
	+ If you press the modifier keys (Alt on Windows, Right Shift on Linux), all rotation actions are reversed: for example, if "1" rotates a port clockwise, "Mod-1" will rotate it counterclockwise.
	+ All docking/undocking/decoupling events while moving are handled properly now.
	+ These improvements make building robotic grappling arms practical.
* 2018-0622: 1.4.3.14 (peteletroll) for KSP 1.4.3.
	+ Recompiled for 1.4.3. Should work with any 1.4.* anyway.
		- Lots of refactoring. I apparently like moving code around a lot.
		- Better handling of going on rails while moving.

	+ added Psycho_zs rotating parts based on NodeRotate
	+ French and Spanish localization

* 2018-0420: 1.4.1.11 (peteletroll) for KSP 1.4.1
	+ Added NodeRotate module
	+ French and Italian localization
	+ Smart autostruts by default
* 2018-0324: 1.4.1.10 (peteletroll) for KSP 1.4.1
	+ Smart Autostruts added, need Advanced Tweakables. Experimental feature!
* 2018-0318: 1.4.1.9 (peteletroll) for KSP 1.4.1
	+ Better precision
	+ Added .version file
