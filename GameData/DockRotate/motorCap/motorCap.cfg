	description = In search for less ugly motorized solutions brave engineers dived deeper into the bottomless pile of robot wreckage. Those who managed to emerge back brought to light this motorized cap. It rotates around its bottom node and provides enough surface area on the rotor to attach other parts. Alternatively it is possible to bolt it onto some surface by the rotor itself, effectively turning rotor into stator, for puns and profit.
